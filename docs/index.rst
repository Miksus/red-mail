This is a sister library for `Red Box, advanced email reader <https://red-box.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Red Mail is a Python library for sending emails. 
It makes sending emails very trivial regardless of whether 
you need to embed images, plots, tables or
attach documents. It also provides you convenient 
templating options and it is easy to create email alerts, 
email reports or client notifications with it.

or `releases in Pypi page <https://pypi.org/project/redmail/>`_.


Why Red Mail?
-------------

Sending emails is a pretty straight forward task.
However, the SMTP and email libraries from the standard library 
don't make it particularly easy. 

Sending emails **SHOULD NOT** look like this:

.. code-block:: python

    import smtplib
    from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
    from email.mime.text import MIMEText

    msg = MIMEMultipart('alternative')
    msg['Subject'] = 'An example email'
    msg['From'] = 'me@example.com'
    msg['To'] = 'you@example.com'

    part1 = MIMEText("Hello!", 'plain')
    part2 = MIMEText("<h1>Hello!</h1>", 'html')

    msg.attach(part1)
    msg.attach(part2)

    # Send the message via our own SMTP server.
    s = smtplib.SMTP('localhost', port=0)
    s.send_message(msg)
    s.quit()


It should look like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from redmail import EmailSender

    email = EmailSender(host="localhost", port=0)

    email.send(
        subject="An example email",
        sender="me@example.com",
        receivers=['you@example.com'],
        text="Hello!",
        html="<h1>Hello!</h1>"
    )

There are also other reasons to use Red Mail:

- :ref:`You can put attachments to the email <attachments>`
- :ref:`You can include images to the body <embedding-images>`
- :ref:`You can render nicer tables to the body <embedding-tables>`
- :ref:`It has Jinja support <jinja-support>`
- :ref:`You can reuse your HTML templates <templating>`
- :ref:`Gmail <config-gmail>` and :ref:`Outlook <config-outlook>` pre-configured
- :ref:`Send with cc and bcc <send-cc-bcc>`
- :ref:`Change the email protocol to what you need <config-smtp>`
- :ref:`Easy to use logging handler <ext-logging>`
- :ref:`Easy to use Flask extension <ext-flask>`
- And it is well tested and documented
